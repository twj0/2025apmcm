## Game Setup

**Players:**
- Player 1: US Government (chooses tariff rate)
- Player 2: Japanese Auto Manufacturers (choose relocation intensity)

**Strategy Spaces:**
- US: Tariff rates = [0.0, 0.1, 0.25]
- Japan: Relocation intensity = [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]

## Nash Equilibria Found

**Number of Pure Strategy Equilibria:** 3


### Equilibrium Details

**Equilibrium 1:**
- US Tariff: 0.0%
- Japan Relocation: 0.0%
- US Payoff: 11.21
- Japan Payoff: 100.00

**Equilibrium 2:**
- US Tariff: 10.0%
- Japan Relocation: 0.0%
- US Payoff: 11.21
- Japan Payoff: 100.00

**Equilibrium 3:**
- US Tariff: 25.0%
- Japan Relocation: 0.0%
- US Payoff: 11.21
- Japan Payoff: 100.00


### Pareto Optimal Equilibria

- Tariff: 0.0%, Relocation: 0.0%
  Payoffs: (US=11.21, Japan=100.00)
- Tariff: 10.0%, Relocation: 0.0%
  Payoffs: (US=11.21, Japan=100.00)
- Tariff: 25.0%, Relocation: 0.0%
  Payoffs: (US=11.21, Japan=100.00)

## Policy Recommendation

**Recommended US Tariff:** 0.0%
**Expected Japan Response:** 0.0% relocation intensity

**Rationale:** This equilibrium represents a stable outcome where neither 
player has incentive to unilaterally deviate from their strategy.
