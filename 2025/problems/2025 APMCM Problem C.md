# Impact of U.S. Tariff Policies on Global Trade and Regional

# Economies

On April 2, 2025, the Trump administration introduced the so-called "Reciprocal

Tariffs" policy, establishing a 10% "minimum baseline tariff" on all trading partners

and imposing additional higher tariffs on approximately 60 countries and regions with

which the U.S. ran trade deficits, including China. The U.S. claimed that varying tariff

rates and non-tariff barriers among trading partners made it harder for American

manufacturers to sell products abroad, leading to persistent U.S. trade deficits and

manufacturing decline. Thus, it imposed "reciprocal tariffs" on all countries to reduce

its trade deficit and promote manufacturing reshoring [1]. However, this policy is

inconsistent with the fundamental principle of "Most-Favored-Nation (MFN)

Treatment" of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and also challenges the WTO's

tariff preference principle for developing countries. Under WTO rules, members must

apply uniform tariffs to all partners, but the Trump administration exercised unilateral

pressure and bilateral negotiations to implement widely varying tariff standards across

economies, with agreed rates far exceeding previous levels. According to a tariff

tracking tool jointly developed by the WTO and International Monetary Fund (IMF),

the U.S. trade-weighted average tariff rate on all products rose sharply from 2.44% at

the start of 2025 to 20.11% by August 2025 [2]. A Yale Budget Lab report noted that

this tariff increase pushed the U.S. overall average effective tariff rate to its highest

level since 1933 [3].

Beyond serving as a source of fiscal revenue, tariffs are an important tool of

national trade policy. Appropriate tariffs can protect domestic industries from global

economic monopoly and coercive practices, and are therefore permitted by the WTO.-1-However, the impact of tariffs is multifaceted. Excessively high tariffs hinder the

development of global trade and are detrimental to long-term world economic growth.

In the short term, high U.S. tariffs may bring benefits such as increased tariff revenue

and a reduced trade deficit, but they also lead to declining exports and higher

domestic consumer prices. For example, according to statistics from General

Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China (GACC) [4], in the

month the "reciprocal tariffs" took effect, U.S. imports from China fell 20%

year-on-year, while U.S. exports to China dropped 13% due to Chinese

countermeasures. By May 2025, imports from China had fallen 35% compared with

May 2024, and exports to China declined 18%. In absolute terms, the U.S. trade

deficit with China narrowed from $30.8 billion in May 2024 to $18.0 billion in May

2025, but U.S. exports to China also fell from $13.2 billion to $10.4 billion,

negatively impacting related U.S. industries. Overall, the adverse effects of high

tariffs on U.S. trade and the economy cannot be overlooked.

Your team is tasked with analyzing the impact of U.S. tariff policy adjustments

on international trade and regional economies, based on U.S. tariff and global trade

data. Address the following questions:

Question 1: The United States, Brazil, and Argentina are the world’s largest

soybean producers and exporters, while China is the largest soybean importer.

Analyze the current state of soybean trade between China and these countries.

Develop a model to assess the impact of U.S. tariff adjustments on the soybean

industries of the U.S., Brazil, and Argentina. Estimate the post-adjustment distribution

of soybean export volumes and values for these three countries.

Question 2: The United States is the world’s second-largest automobile market

and the largest automobile importer. In 2024, 46% of cars sold in the U.S. were

imported [5], with Japan as a major source. Besides direct exports from Japan,

Japanese automakers also invest in U.S. production or manufacture in countries like

Mexico for export to the U.S. Analyze the current position of Japanese automobiles in

the U.S. market. Develop a model that incorporates Japan’s non-tariff response-2-strategies and economic transmission effects to examine the impact of U.S. tariff

adjustments on U.S.-Japan automobile trade, the structure of U.S. auto imports, and

the U.S. automobile industry.

Question 3: The United States dominates the global semiconductor (chip)

industry but lacks strong manufacturing capacity. The Biden administration passed the

CHIPS and Science Act in August 2022, using subsidies to boost advanced

semiconductor manufacturing. However, the Trump administration in 2025 argued

that tariffs are more effective than subsidies. Concurrently, the U.S. imposed export

controls on high-end chips to China, citing national security and technological

leadership concerns. Develop a model analyzing the effects of U.S. tariff policies on

domestic semiconductor manufacturing and trade in high-, mid-, and low-end chips,

considering both economic efficiency and national security.

Question 4: Raising tariff rates may increase government tariff revenue in the

short term but reduce trade volumes, potentially lowering revenue over time. Develop

a model to analyze the short- and medium-term impact of U.S. tariff adjustments on

U.S. tariff revenue. Predict the net change resulting from these adjustments in U.S.

tariff revenue during the second term of the Trump administration.

Question 5: U.S. tariff hikes may trigger countermeasures from trading partners.

For instance, China imposed reciprocal tariff countermeasures and implemented

targeted export controls on rare earths, lithium batteries, etc. [9]. These

countermeasures will undoubtedly bring complex impacts on U.S. foreign trade,

thereby exerting comprehensive and profound effects on agriculture, industry, and

other sectors within the United States, and may also affect financial markets such as

the U.S. dollar, U.S. Treasury bonds, and virtual currencies. Select or construct

economic indicators to model the short- and medium-term impact of U.S. tariff

adjustments on the U.S. economy. Use the model to evaluate whether the "reciprocal

tariffs" policy can genuinely drive manufacturing reshoring.

Glossary：-3-- Reciprocal Tariffs: Originally refers to a system where two or more countries

mutually reduce or eliminate import tariffs through bilateral or multilateral

negotiations. Here, it specifically denotes the tariff policy announced by the Trump

administration on April 2, 2025. While nominally implying equal tariff rates between

the U.S. and its partners, the U.S. imposed a 10% "minimum baseline tariff" on all

partners and additional tariffs ranging from 11% to 50% on approximately 60 trading

partners.

- Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) Treatment: Refers to the tariff and non-tariff

preferential treatments mutually granted by WTO members that are no less favorable

than those granted to any third country. According to Article I of the General

Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT 1994), any preference granted by a member

to another member must be immediately and unconditionally extended to all other

members.
